Time Period: t-1 to t

Return Calculations:

    Simple Return (R):
    Rt,i=Pt,i−Pt−1,iPt−1,i
    Rt,i​=Pt−1,i​Pt,i​−Pt−1,i​​
US Equity Market Returns (2020-2023)

    Annual Returns:
        2020: +18.40%
        2021: +28.71%
        2022: -18.11%
        2023: +26.29%

Cumulative Returns Over Rolling Periods

    Example: An investment in US equities from 1 March 2009 to 28 February 2014 yielded a return of 181.5%.

Exercise Question: Apple Stock Return Calculation

    Apple Share Price:
        23 March 2020: $56.09
        23 March 2021: $122.54

Return Calculation:

    Simple Return:
    Rsimple=122.54−56.0956.09≈118.54%
    Rsimple​=56.09122.54−56.09​≈118.54%

    Continuously Compounded Return:
    Rlog=ln⁡(122.5456.09)≈79.22%
    Rlog​=ln(56.09122.54​)≈79.22%

    where Pt,iPt,i​ is the price at time tt and Pt−1,iPt−1,i​ is the price at the previous time period.

    Continuously Compounded Return (Log Return):
    Rt,i=ln⁡(Pt,iPt−1,i)
    Rt,i​=ln(Pt−1,i​Pt,i​​)


# 3. Summary: International Asset Pricing Theories

Outline:

    International Parity Relations
    Introduction to International Asset Pricing
    Base-line International CAPM
    Structure of More General IAPMs

Key Concepts:
1. Starting Point of International Asset Pricing:

    Numeraire Currencies: Investors use different base currencies.
    Exchange Rate Movements: Returns on international investments are directly and indirectly affected by exchange rate changes.
    Economic Interrelation: Asset prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates are interconnected.
    Investment Analysis: Requires understanding of foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation rates (international parity relations).

2. Definitions:

    Spot Exchange Rate (S): Immediate currency exchange rate.
    Forward Exchange Rate (F): Future currency exchange rate.
    Interest Rate (R): Rate for borrowing/lending in a certain currency.
    Inflation Rate (π): Rate of consumer price index (CPI) increase.

3. Key International Parity Relations:

    Commodity Price Parity (CPP): Real price of goods is the same across countries.
    Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): Spot exchange rates adjust to inflation differentials.
    Fisher Relation: Interest rate fluctuations are due to expected inflation changes.
    Foreign Exchange Expectation Relation: Forward exchange rates mirror expected future spot rates.
    Interest Rate Parity: Forward premium reflects interest rate differentials between countries.

4. Base-line International CAPM (Stulz 1984):

    Assumptions: No differences in consumption and investment opportunities across countries, perfect markets, and no barriers to international investment.
    Consequences: Expected real returns are the same for all investors; all investors desire a combination of a risk-free asset and a world market portfolio.
    Nominal Terms: Assumes existence of a risk-free asset with zero world market beta and uncorrelated inflation rate to nominal returns.

5. More General International Asset Pricing Models (IAPMs):

    Utility-based Equilibrium IAPMs: Consider differences in consumption and investment opportunities (Stulz, Solnik, Adler/Dumas).
    Arbitrage-motivated IAPMs: Assume barriers to international investments or factors driving exchange rates are the same as asset returns.

6. Specific IAPMs:

    Stulz (1984, 1994): Assumes identical consumption and investment opportunities across countries.
    Solnik (1974): Differences in consumption opportunities, exchange rate risk hedging, portfolio of risk-free bonds.
    Adler and Dumas (1983): Multi-beta pricing model considering world market risk and inflation risk, with a focus on individual inflation hedge portfolios.

7. Critical Insights:

    Hedging Properties: Internationally traded assets' hedging properties vary based on the country's perspective.
    Investment Portfolios: Investors from different countries hold different portfolios and face different risk-return evaluations.
    Market Clearing: Equilibrium pricing across heterogeneous investors.

8. Exercise Examples:

    Apple Stock Return Calculation: Evaluate the real return on Apple shares by considering changes in stock price and inflation.
    PPP Predictions: Predict future exchange rates based on inflation differentials.
    Interest Rate Parity Application: Calculate forward exchange rates using spot rates and interest rate differentials.

# 4. Summary: Rational Asset Pricing and Multifactor Models

Key Concepts:
1. Major Conclusions:

    Global Risk Factors: Three out of seven global risk factors systematically affect both stock and bond returns, indicating the co-movement between international stock and bond markets.

2. Applications of Factor Profiles in Portfolio Management:

    Fundamental Analysis: Factor exposures help identify economic determinants of volatility, aiding efficient data collection and analysis.
    Diversification: Cross-sectional patterns of factor risk profiles enhance portfolio diversification by considering various risk factors.
    Pricing Potential: Differences in expected returns relate to risk factors and their exposures across assets.
    Hedging: Factor exposures form the basis for minimum-variance hedging strategies.

3. Unconditional Beta Pricing Tests:

    Asset Pricing Restriction: The relationship between long-term expected returns, factor changes, and factor rewards can be described by the beta pricing relationship:
    E[ri]=λ1βi1+λ2βi2+⋯+λkβik
    E[ri​]=λ1​βi1​+λ2​βi2​+⋯+λk​βik​
    Empirical Testing: The model is tested using restricted seemingly unrelated regression equations across 17 stock markets and 8 bond markets, assuming integrated global risks.

4. Study Conclusions:

    Volatility Drivers: International stock returns are influenced by more global risk factors than bond returns. Key drivers for both are the world market portfolio excess return, global long-term interest rate changes, and G7 exchange rate basket changes.
    Value Drivers:
        Single-Factor CAPM: Identifies a positive premium for world market risk exposure in long-term stock and bond returns.
        Three-Factor Model: Provides a clearer picture, including rewards for interest rate risk and some evidence of exchange rate risk being priced.

5. Empirical Study on Emerging Markets:

    Model Specification: Follows Harvey (1995) to explore risks in emerging markets.
    Sample and Period: Analyzes 25 emerging markets and 23 developed markets from December 30, 1992, to March 31, 2010.
    Factors:
        World stock market return (WDRET)
        Change in long-term interest rates (INTR)
        Return on S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index Industrial Metals (CMDTY)
        Change in the external value of the euro (CRNCY)
        Emerging market return orthogonal to WDRET (EMF)

Exercises:

    Factor Impact Analysis: Evaluate how a 10% increase in a factor affects stock markets, hedge factor risks, and determine variance captured by factors.
    Expected Returns: Calculate expected returns for specific stock markets based on factor models.

# 5. Summary: Forecasting Returns and Conditional Asset Pricing

Key Concepts:
1. Equity Performance and the Business Cycle:

    Correlation with World Economy: Equity returns are highly correlated with the global business cycle, affecting all markets.

2. Mechanics of the Yield Curve:

    Term Spread: Reflects economic growth expectations. A steep yield curve often predicts economic expansions, while an inverted curve can indicate recessions.

3. Empirical Findings of Dahlquist and Harvey (2001):

    US Equity Returns: Average returns during recessions are about one third of those during expansions.
    Global Sensitivity: Most countries' equity returns are more sensitive to the US business cycle than US returns themselves.
    Volatility and Correlations: Higher volatility and correlations are observed during US recessions globally.

4. Predictive Power of the Term Spread:

    Study by Wheelock/Wohar (FED of St. Louis):
        Output Growth and Recessions: The term spread can predict both output growth and recessions in the US, Germany, and the UK.
        Yield Curve Inversion: A precursor to recessions, with every US recession since 1953 preceded by a significant yield curve inversion.

5. Fama and French (1989):

    Research Questions:
        Expected Returns: Investigates if expected returns on bonds and stocks move together and are influenced by common variables.
        Business Conditions: Examines if variations in expected returns relate to business conditions.
    Method: Regressions of excess returns on common explanatory variables like dividend yield, term spread, and default spread.

6. Business Expectations:

    Instrumental Variables:
        Expected GDP growth, capacity utilization, money supply aggregates, housing starts, term structure of interest rates.
        Impact: These variables influence both dividends and the discount factor.

7. Default Risk and Investors' Sentiment:

    Default Risk: Measured by credit spreads (BBB-AAA) and credit insurance premiums.
    Investors' Sentiment: Gauged using market sentiment indices, consumer confidence measures, and put/call ratio.

8. Predictive Regression Model:

    Foundation: Rational expectations model.
    Implementation:
    rit=θi0+θi1Z1,t−1+θi2Z2,t−1+⋯+θijZj,t−1+ϵit
    rit​=θi0​+θi1​Z1,t−1​+θi2​Z2,t−1​+⋯+θij​Zj,t−1​+ϵit​
    where ritrit​ is the excess return, Zj,t−1Zj,t−1​ are instrumental variables, and θijθij​ are their impacts.

9. Conditioning Information in Asset Pricing:

    Modeling Time-Varying Risk Premiums:
        Assumes a linear relationship between instrument levels and risk premium levels.
        Utilizes instruments like global dividend yield, global inflation rate, global term spread, US default spread, and TED spread.

10. Market Integration:

    Concept: Markets are integrated if assets with the same risk have the same expected returns, regardless of the market they are traded in.
    Indicators: Return correlations, volatility spillovers, and factor exposures.

11. Analysis of Pricing Consistency:

    Major Steps: Identifying factors, estimating global risk premiums, and analyzing pricing errors.
    Global CAPM and Multifactor Models: Used to test for market integration and pricing consistency.

12. Multifactor Models Overview:

    Applications: Analyzing risk profiles, explaining return variance, generating expected returns for asset allocation.
    Types of Models: Multifactor model, multifactor asset pricing model, instrumental forecasting model, conditional asset pricing model.

# 6. Summary: Asset Allocation

Key Concepts:
1. BHB Model – Analysis of Portfolio Return:

    Attribution of Active Returns:
        Components:
            Timing: Difference between actual and passive timing.
            Selection: Difference between actual and passive selection.
            Other: Residual difference, representing unexplained returns.
            Total: Overall difference between actual and passive returns.
        Results:
            Timing: -0.66%
            Selection: -0.36%
            Other: -0.07%
            Total: -1.10%
        Mean Annualized Returns (1974-1983):
            Actual Return: 9.01%
            Passive Timing: 9.44%
            Passive Selection: 9.75%
            Total Passive: 10.11%

2. BHB Model – Analysis of Portfolio Risk:

    Results:
        Investment policy return explains 93.6% of total return variation on average (min 75.8%, max 98.6%).
        Timing returns add 1.7% on average to explained variation.
        Selection returns add 4.2% on average to explained variation.

3. Real Return Experiences Across Generations:

    Historical and Recent Trends:
        Real Interest Rates: Significant boost to asset prices due to falling real interest rates; sharp rise in real yields in 2022.
        Generational Returns:
            Baby Boomers: Higher returns due to the "golden age" of bonds.
            Generation Z: Investing under new conditions with lower expected returns.

4. Tactical Asset Allocation and Overlay Management:

    Goals:
        Increase expected portfolio return.
        Stabilize performance.
    Categories of Portfolio Overlays:
        Risk-Oriented: Rebalancing, CPPI, portfolio insurance.
        Market-Oriented: Timing, switching, GTAA (Global Tactical Asset Allocation).

5. Study: Conditional Asset Allocation Over the First Decade:

    Tactical Overlay Management:
        Stock-Bond Quota: Adjusting allocations based on market conditions.
        Currency Allocation: Adjusting exposure to different currencies.
        Regions and Countries: Balancing investments across geographic regions.

6. Hierarchical 1/N Portfolio Construction:

    Motivation:
        Criticism of traditional approaches like cap-weighted stock benchmarks.
        Short price histories of alternative asset classes.
        Illiquidity issues in valuation of some alternative assets.
    Structure:
        Level 1: Investment segment.
        Level 2: Investment region.
        Level 3: Maturity of the market.
        Level 4: Currency region.
    Hypothesis: 1/N portfolios dominate mean-variance (MV) optimized portfolios due to robustness against estimation and model risks.

Exercise Question: Evaluation of Active Competences of Fund Management:

    Given Data:
        Benchmark weights: 30% equity, 70% fixed income.
        Actual weights: 40% equity, 60% fixed income.
        Passive equity return: 4.5%, passive fixed income return: 1.5%.
        Active returns: Equity 5%, fixed income 1%.
    Evaluation:
        Timing and Selection: Analyze the fund's performance in adjusting weights and choosing investments relative to passive benchmarks.

# 7. Summary: Equity investments

Key Concepts:
1. Market Philosophy:

    Efficient Markets: Markets where prices fully reflect all available information.
    Efficiently Inefficient Markets: Markets where prices mostly reflect available information but allow for some inefficiencies.

2. Exercise on Stock Valuation:

    Intrinsic Value Calculation:
        Given Data:
            Next dividend: EUR 4.50
            Dividend growth rate: 5%
            Discount factor: 8%
        Intrinsic Value Formula:
        Intrinsic Value=DividendDiscount Factor−Growth Rate=4.500.08−0.05=EUR150
        Intrinsic Value=Discount Factor−Growth RateDividend​=0.08−0.054.50​=EUR150
        Market Price Comparison:
            Current market price: EUR 130
            The stock is undervalued compared to its intrinsic value.
        Impact of Lower Growth Rate:
            New growth rate: 4%
            New intrinsic value: 4.500.08−0.04=EUR112.500.08−0.044.50​=EUR112.50

3. Value-Oriented Equity Selection:

    Characteristics of Value Stocks:
        Tend to outperform growth stocks.
        Indicators: High book/price, dividend/price, earnings/price, cash flow/price, sales/price ratios.
        Be cautious of value traps (stocks that appear cheap but have deteriorating fundamentals).

4. Warren Buffett's Investment Approach:

    Characteristics of Stocks Purchased:
        Safe, cheap, high-quality.
        Study “Buffett’s Alpha” by Frazzini/Kabiller/Pedersen (2013) highlights significant outperformance and low volatility.

5. Modern Equity Strategies:

    Factor-Based Strategies:
        Based on empirical findings on valuation-relevant factors like size, value, momentum.
        Reflect exposure to economic or behavioral risks in capital markets.
        Systematic risk premiums resulting from these factors.

6. Study on Factor-Based Strategies:

    Analysis of Global MSCI Indices:
        Examines five popular investment styles: Value, Small Cap, Quality, Momentum, Minimum Volatility.
        Analyzes the equity risk premium and factor risk premia across business cycle phases.
        Findings suggest factor strategies can diversify economic risk.

7. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs):

    Investment Fund Traded on Stock Exchanges:
        Provides benefits such as low costs, liquidity, diversification, tax efficiency.
        Replication Methods:
            Physical Replication: Full or sampling of securities.
            Synthetical Replication: Based on swap transactions.
    Growth Drivers:
        Intraday trading, diversification, cost efficiency, asset allocation.

8. Study on ETF Investors:

    Characteristics of Retail Investors:
        More likely to invest in passive ETFs (P-ETFs) if better educated, with higher financial knowledge, longer investment horizons, and more diversified portfolios.
        Less likely if aiming for higher target returns or suffering from overconfidence.

9. Popular ETFs:

    Examples of ETFs Tracking the MSCI World:
        iShares Core (Physical replication, 0.20% TER, 10.65% performance 2015-19)
        Xtrackers (Synthetic replication, 0.45% TER, 10.60% performance 2015-19)
        UBS (Physical replication, 0.30% TER, 10.48% performance 2015-19)
